This project is part of a requirement for Getting and Cleaning Data. This is to demonstrate on how to get and clean the datasets.
The raw dataset used for this project comes from the research paper which recognizes Human Activity through Smartphones sensor (Anguita et.al, 2012).

There are two tidy datasets:
subject_mean.csv: shows all the mean features from the raw datasets by subject
activity_mean.csv: shows all the mean features from the raw datasets by activity

These datasets were generated by running "run_analysis.R" which merges the train and test datasets from the raw dataset. It then filters all the mean features by subject or activity.
